# Prophecy

A neovim plugin for Oracle. Currently supports querying and describing objects. Many more features planned.

## Dependencies
* Neovim (recent build) - unfortunately I need the async and job control functions of neovim.
* Python 2.7
* PyQt4
* Qt4
* cx_Oracle - which means you need a working Oracle client installation as well.
* python-dateutil
