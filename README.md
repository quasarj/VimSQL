# Prophecy

A neovim plugin for Oracle. Currently supports querying and describing objects. Many more features planned.

## Dependencies
* Neovim (recent build; sorry won't work with normal vim)
* Python 2.7 (and the python neovim package)
* PyQt5 (and thus Qt5)
* cx_Oracle - which means you need a working Oracle client installation as well.
* python-dateutil
